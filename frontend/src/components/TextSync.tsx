      <h2 className='text-[23px] lg:text-4xl font-med'>Hi, I’m Rishav Pattnaik, a developer who enjoys building software with clarity and intention. I like turning ideas into well-structured systems by writing clean code, debugging thoughtfully, and refining logic until things work the way they should. For me, development is as much about understanding how systems behave as it is about building features.<br/><br/>I spend time breaking problems down, questioning assumptions, and making design choices that keep code readable and maintainable over time. Whether it’s improving a data model, fixing edge cases, or refining an existing feature, I value precision, patience, and continuous improvement. Each project I build reflects my focus on structure, reliability, and thoughtful engineering.</h2>
